This zip was created on rep_create_date.

It contains data collected as part of the 'rep_study_name' at CAMH (PI: rep_pi_name).

We have included NIfTI (.nii.gz) files for T1, for an MRI conducted at CAMH on rep_scan_date.

If viewing NIfTI files, open 'local_viewer.html' in an internet browser of your choice. Import an image by clicking 'File', then 'Add Image...' and choose the NIfTI file within the data folder. Before importing a new image, click 'File', then 'Close All'.

All image headers have been cleaned but images have NOT been de-faced.
